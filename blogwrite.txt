Note: This project is an exerpt of exercise 21 from the book 'Learn Python The Hard Way'

In this project we will do the following:
1. Define a function that adds up two numbers.
2. Define a function that subtracts two numbers.
3. Define a function that multiplies two numbers.
4. Define a function that devides two numbers.
5. Tell user that program is going to do math.
6. Use the add function to add 30 with 5 
then assign the value to a variable 'age'.
7. Use the subtract function to subtract 4 from 78
then assign the value to a variable 'height'.
8. Use the multiply function to multiply 90 with 2
then assign the value to a variable 'weight'.
9. Use the devide function to devide 100 with 2
then assign the value to a variable 'iq'.
10. Print out a sentence to tell variable age, height, weight, iq.
11. Tell user that program is going to print out a puzzle.
12. Use the functions to do: age + (height - weight * iq / 2)
13. Do: age + (height - weight * iq / 2) without using those functions.
14. Tell user the calculated values from the above lines.
15. Assign variables needed for later calculations.
16. Define a function 'find_area' that calculates an area of a triangle.
17. Tell user the area of a triangle using the 'find_area' function.
18. Tell user the area of a triangle using the 'multiply' function.

Result:
